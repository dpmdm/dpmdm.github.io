      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I have always seen documentation as critical part of software engineering. Not only as helpful comments in the code, but also to document the infrastructure and way-of-working.
Some times I wonder if IT and archeology should be more connected. So many times knowledge are hidden by employees. All these time consuming handovers when people quit or change positions.
The other side is that I have a short memory.</description>

      <description>Is it a good to try to exaplain how this site will grow&amp;hellip;.
My initial thinking is that I will collect my &amp;ldquo;knowledge&amp;rdquo; into
 blog posts articles  It would be great if the blog post can in some way lead to articles. Is it possilby to see the blogs as &amp;ldquo;behind the scenes&amp;rdquo; of the articles?
Hm&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Why not start to write down my thoughts in a blog?
I see my self as 30 years old.
 A decade when I grown up A decade with studies A decade with work  That will sum up to 20 years of thinking about software engineering. But what would the purpose of it be?
 If someone will read it, that&amp;rsquo;s great! I can show my family why I&amp;rsquo;m sitting up late Get my own material of the things I work on  Thats it, I will do it!</description>
